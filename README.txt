This is the SBLAs repository of yt simulations and absorption-line spectra 
obtained with Trident. 

QSO, galaxy and QSO+galaxy catalogs can be found in "Catalogs" folder. Scripts used to obtain the catalogs are in "Scripts" folder.


All the simulation files obtained can be found using these links:
